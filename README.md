# Notion as CMS

In this project, we are using Notion as CMS and getting the content dynamically from our notion account. 

#### In the backend

I am using notion client, which helps me to make api calls directly to my notion content.

I have setup different routes to get database information like how many fields my database have, the pages that are inside the database and the content that is inside those pages.


#### In the frontend

I am using ShadCN library for the UI and dynamically fetching the data by calling the backend routes. 
If a particular field only has a single page, then I rendering it directly and if it has mutliple pages, I am displaying them as cards.
Also, The rich text that is being used in the notion pages, that css is applied while displaying the pages content too as well as extra line breaks are also being displayed.

### Challenges 

The main challenge was understanding how different component in notion works and what routes should I be hitting to get the right data.
So, I can work with it.

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
